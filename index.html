    <h3>(Welcome back to the site Axis!)</h3>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Fishes are 
      <ul>
        <li>Nice to eat</li>
        <li>Cute</li>
        <li>Smexy</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here at fishy, we care about fish. They are cute, subtle creatures.
      All fish share two traits: they live in water and they have a backbone—they are vertebrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from these similarities, however, many of the species in this group differ markedly from one another. Fin fish like salmon have gills, are covered in scales, and reproduce by laying eggs. Eels, by contrast, have worm-like bodies and exceedingly slimy skin. Lungfish gulp air. Whale sharks, the largest fish, give birth to live young and eat only tiny fish, squid, and plankton. Some species, such as the weedy sea dragon, are so bizarre they seem almost unreal.

    <h2>Fighter fish</h2>

    <p>
      The Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), commonly known as the betta, is a freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia, namely Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is one of 73 species of the genus Betta, but the only one eponymously called "betta", owing to its global popularity as a pet; Betta splendens are among the most popular aquarium fish in the world, due to their diverse and colorful morphology and relatively low maintenance.

Siamese fighting fish are endemic to the central plain of Thailand, where they were first domesticated at least 1,000 years ago, among the longest of any fish.] They were initially bred for aggression and subject to gambling matches akin to cockfighting. Bettas became known outside Thailand through King Rama III (1788-1851), who is said to have given some to Theodore Cantor, a Danish physician, zoologist, and botanist. They first appeared in the West in the late 19th century, and within decades became popular as ornamental fish. Their long history of selective breeding has produced a wide variety of coloration and finnage, earning them the moniker, "designer fish of the aquatic world".

    <h2>Angel fish</h2>

    <p>
      Pterophyllum scalare, most commonly referred to as angelfish or freshwater angelfish, is the most common species of Pterophyllum kept in captivity. It is native to the Amazon Basin in Peru, Colombia, and Brazil. Particularly to the Ucayali river in Peru, the Oyapock River in French Guiana, the Essequibo River in Guyana, the Solimões, the Amapá, and the Amazon rivers in Brazil. It is found in swamps or flooded grounds where vegetation is dense and the water is either clear or silty. Its native water conditions range from a pH of 7.0 to 6.0, a water hardness range of 3 to 10 °dH, and water temperature ranging from 26 to 30 °C (75 to 86 °F).

    <h2>Why Fish are important to the ecosystem</h2>
      <p>
        Nitrogen and phosphorus are crucial nutrients in aquatic ecosystems as most organisms at
the base of the food chain rely on them. Considering that the recycling of nutrients is directly
influenced by fishes, an American team of scientists has recently investigated the impacts of
fish extinction on nutrients recycling processes. Their results highlight the complexity of
predicting the consequences of extinctions from species-rich animal communities.
Nevertheless, the importance of exploited fish species in nutrient recycling suggests that
overfishing could have particularly detrimental effects on ecosystem functioning.

    <h2>Conclusion and credits</h2>
    <p>At the end of the day, what we learnt from this is that fishes are awesome. And they are an important part of the ecosystem.</p>
